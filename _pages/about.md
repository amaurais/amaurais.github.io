I am a final-year Computational Science and Engineering PhD student at MIT working with [Youssef Marzouk](https://uqgroup.mit.edu/). I make use of geometry and structure to develop principled computational methods for probabilistic modeling, which encompasses Bayesian inference, generative modeling, and data science. My current focus is on the development and analysis of dynamic measure transport algorithms for sampling in density-driven settings. Prior to beginning my PhD I received bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Computational Modeling and Data Analytics from Virginia Tech (2019) and spent some time on the technical staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. My work has been funded by the National Science Foundation and Google. 

**I will complete my PhD in Spring 2026 and am seeking postdoctoral and faculty positions to commence in Fall 2026 or later.**
