I am a final-year Computational Science and Engineering PhD student at MIT working with [Youssef Marzouk](https://uqgroup.mit.edu/). I develop and analyze computational methods for Bayesian inference, uncertainty quantification, and generative modeling. I am currently focused on developing and understanding dynamic measure transport algorithms for sampling in scientific settings like data assimilation. 
Prior to beginning my graduate work I received bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Computational Modeling and Data Analytics from Virginia Tech (2019) and spent some time on the technical staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory developing algorithms and software for anomaly detection. 

**I will complete my PhD in Spring 2026 and am seeking postdoctoral and faculty positions to commence in Fall 2026 or later.**
