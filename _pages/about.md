I am a Computational Science and Engineering PhD student at MIT working with [Youssef Marzouk](https://uqgroup.mit.edu/). My work broadly falls under the umbrella of Bayesian inference and uncertainty quantification and has connections to scientific computing and machine-learning. I am currently interested in understanding and improving inference through the lenses of geometry and dynamics. Prior to beginning my graduate work I received bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Computational Modeling and Data Analytics from Virginia Tech (2019) and spent some time on the technical staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory developing algorithms and software for anomaly detection.
